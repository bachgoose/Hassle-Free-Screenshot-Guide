# Taking Screenshot in a Hassle-Free Way on Linux, macOs, or Windows 10

## Why do you need to care?
Knowing how to take a screenshot of your computer screen in a quickest possible way is quite an important skill to have. From creating online articles, blog or forum posts, work-related emails, error-reporting, down to performing system troubleshooting with a remote assistant, screenshots can help to elaborate your problem or situation. It can also be used as evidence to support your statement (hopefully not in a legal-ish way).

I write this short article (or guide, whatever) initially as a way to stop myself from googling "how to take a screenshot in Windows/Mac/Linux" in a hasty way and kept forgetting to write it down afterwards, all the time. I had enough with these horrendous cycles. 

I will show you two methods to take a screenshot for each Operating System (OS). First, by using the keyboard shortcuts (this is the quickest way) and second, by using a built-in program in your OS. **No time to google and install another app when you are in a hurry!** The OS used in this guide are Linux Mint 21.1 Mate Edition, macOS Catalina 10.15.3, and Windows 10. So lets get started!

## Creating a screenshot in Linux Mint
### By using keyboard 
These two methods will open a **Save Screenshot** window where you can rename, select save location, copy to clipboard (and paste it to another app), create a new one, or cancel the current one and exit the window. By default, the file format is png, but you can also use jpg or gif format.
* Press `PrintScreen` or `PrtSrc` button to take a full screenshot (the entire screen, including your secondary screen)

    * *"Select area to grab"*: Your cursor will change to a crosshair, select an area on your screen by clicking and holding your left mouse button, then drag it to create a selection. Release the mouse button to open a "Save Screenshot" window (same thing as in keyboard shortcuts method).
    * You can specify a delay time before the app will take a screenshot automatically.
